                                            Login Authentication System
Description:

The Login Authentication System is a secure web-based interface that allows users to access protected resources only after successful identity verification. It ensures that only authorized individuals can log into the system by validating user credentials (email and password) through a backend API.
This project focuses on creating a responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing login page that includes password visibility toggling and real-time error handling.

Uniqueness:

Modern UI Design: Built with elegant gradients and card-style layouts using CSS3, giving a clean and professional look.

Frontend Validation: Ensures no empty fields are submitted, improving user experience before sending data to the backend.

Interactive Password Toggle: Users can easily show or hide their password input for convenience and accuracy.

Scalable Backend Integration: Frontend is designed to securely communicate with backend APIs, supporting JWT tokens or OAuth for real-world use.

Redirect Logic: Includes automatic redirection to a dashboard after successful login, simulating real app behavior.

Reusable Component: Can be easily integrated into any website or web app needing secure authentication.
